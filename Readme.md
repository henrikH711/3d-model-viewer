#3d blender model support interface 

This is a small project that I write in js by using the threeJS import library.
Basically it's a 3d enviroment that only supports .glb, .gltf files and runs on web.
Technologies that I'm using for this project:
   * HTML and css
   * 
  *JavaScript (as mentioned above)

I haven't give a name for this project yet..
Maybe I'll transform this into a react-app. 
I'm just testing my skills on this.
