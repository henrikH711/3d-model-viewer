#3d blender model support interface 

This is a small project that I write in js by using the threeJS import library.
Basically it's a 3d enviroment that only supports .glb, .gltf files and runs on web.
Technologies that I'm using for this project:
   * HTML and css
   * JavaScript & threeJS (as mentioned above)
Features:
*Drag-and-drop support for uploading .glb and .gltf files.

*Interactive camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom).(coming soon)

*Adjustable lighting and background for enhanced visualization. (coming soon)

*Timeline for animations (coming soon)

I haven't give a name for this project yet..
I'm going to turn this  into a react-app later as I progress through my learning course.  :)
